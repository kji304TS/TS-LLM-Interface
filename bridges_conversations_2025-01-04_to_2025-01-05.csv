user: i need help transfering eth from optimism network to world chain 
bot: To transfer ETH from Optimism to World Chain, you'll need to use a bridge that supports both networks. Unfortunately, our MetaMask bridge doesn't currently support World Chain. Here's what you can do:

First, bridge your ETH from Optimism back to Ethereum mainnet using the official Optimism bridge (https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit).
Once your ETH is on Ethereum mainnet, visit the World Chain's official website (https://world.org/world-chain) to find supported bridges for transferring to World Chain.
Use one of the supported bridges to move your ETH from Ethereum mainnet to World Chain.

Remember to keep some ETH for gas fees on each network during the process.

765942,"Question
The customer contacted us because they did not receive ETH sent from another app to their MetaMask wallet via BSC network.Summary‚Ä¢ Customer did not receive ETH sent from another app to their MetaMask wallet via BSC network.
‚Ä¢ Customer provided transaction hash and confirmed wallet address.
‚Ä¢ Teammate asked for screenshot of wallet assets and if BNB network was added.
‚Ä¢ Customer later found the tokens and apologized for misunderstanding.
‚Ä¢ Conversation ended with teammate checking if customer could see the tokens and closing the conversation due to inactivity.","bot: There are a few reasons why you might not see the payment in your MetaMask account:

Network mismatch: Ensure you're on the correct network in MetaMask. If the funds were sent on a different network, you'll need to add that network to your wallet.
Token not imported: If the token isn't automatically displayed, you may need to import it manually. You can do this by:‚Ä¢ Going to your MetaMask wallet‚Ä¢ Searching for ""Import tokens"" under the correct network‚Ä¢ Clicking on ""Custom Token""‚Ä¢ Entering the token's contract address
Transaction verification: Use a block explorer (like etherscan.com for Ethereum) to check if the transaction was successful. Enter your wallet address in the search bar to view all transactions.

If the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain but still not visible in MetaMask, try the steps above. If issues persist, you may need to contact the sending app's support for more information.

The customer contacted us because they did not see their bridged Polygon funds in their Ethereum wallet.Summary‚Ä¢ Customer bridged $980 worth of Polygon to Ethereum but did not see it in their wallet
‚Ä¢ Teammate confirmed customer's version and public address
‚Ä¢ Teammate checked transaction and confirmed ETH was sent to customer's wallet on Ethereum mainnet
‚Ä¢ Customer did not see ETH in their MetaMask wallet at first, but it eventually showed up
‚Ä¢ Teammate reminded customer to never share sensitive information and offered further assistance if needed.","bot: To locate your recent bridge transaction, you can follow these steps:

Open MetaMask and go to the 'Activity' tab of your account. Your transaction should appear there, showing whether you were sending or receiving.
Click on the transaction to view its details. You'll see an option to 'View on block explorer' which will provide more information.
Alternatively, you can directly check the blockchain explorer:‚Ä¢ Copy your wallet address from MetaMask‚Ä¢ Go to the appropriate block explorer for the network you used‚Ä¢ Paste your address into the search bar‚Ä¢ Look for your transaction in the list provided

Remember, a bridge transaction involves multiple steps on different networks, so you may need to check both the source and destination network explorers. If you're having trouble locating the transaction, double-check that you've completed both the approval and the actual bridge transaction.

765047,No summary available,"bot: To transfer SOL from the BNB Smart Chain to the Ethereum network, you'll need to use a bridge. A bridge allows you to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks. You can't directly send tokens from one blockchain to another, as they remain on their original chain.
We recommend using the MetaMask bridge feature in our Portfolio dApp for this process. You can find detailed instructions on how to use the MetaMask Bridge here: MetaMask Bridge Instructions.
Remember, you'll need to have enough BNB tokens in your wallet to cover the gas fees for the bridging transaction.
bot: Did that answer your question?
user: enough mean how much
bot: The exact amount of BNB needed for gas fees when bridging SOL from BNB Smart Chain to Ethereum varies and isn't fixed. Gas fees fluctuate based on network traffic and can change frequently. To know the precise amount, you'll need to initiate the transaction in MetaMask, which will then display the required gas fees.
When using the MetaMask bridge, you'll pay:

Gas fees on the source network (BNB Smart Chain in this case)
The MetaMask fee (0.875% of the total transaction value)
Any fees charged by bridge providers
Gas fees on the destination network (Ethereum)

Generally, BNB Smart Chain fees are lower compared to Ethereum. You'll need some BNB tokens in your wallet to cover these gas fees, otherwise, you won't be able to perform the transaction.

765918,No summary available,"bot: Hi there!
user: I have USDT in BINANCE smart chain network. 
bot: To manage or transfer your USDT on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network using MetaMask, follow these steps:

Add the BSC network to MetaMask by clicking on the networks section and selecting ""Add"" next to Binance Smart Chain. If not visible, you may need to manually add the network.
Import the USDT token by clicking ""Import token,"" then ""Custom tokens."" Paste the USDT contract address for BSC: 0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955. The token symbol and decimals will auto-fill.
Ensure you have BNB tokens in your wallet to cover gas fees for any transactions on the BSC network.
When transferring USDT, select the BSC network in MetaMask and use your recipient's BSC address.

Remember, all transactions on BSC require BNB for gas fees.
bot: Did that answer your question?
user: How to transfer to ETH mainnet 
bot: To transfer your USDT from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network to the Ethereum mainnet using MetaMask, you'll need to use a bridge. Here's how:

Use the MetaMask Bridge feature in the MetaMask Portfolio dApp. This allows you to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks.
Follow the instructions in our guide on how to use the MetaMask Bridge: MetaMask Bridge Instructions.
Remember, you can't directly send tokens from one blockchain to another. The bridge facilitates this transfer between different networks.
Ensure you have enough native tokens (BNB for BSC, ETH for Ethereum) to cover gas fees on both networks.

If you need more detailed guidance, check our Field Guide to Bridges.
